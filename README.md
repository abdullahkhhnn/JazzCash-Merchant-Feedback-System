# JazzCash-Merchant-Feedback-System

This repository contains a demo version of the Merchant Feedback System I developed during my internship as a B2B Intern at Jazz.

⚠️ Disclaimer: The original project was built using real JazzCash merchant data, which cannot be shared due to company policies. This repo contains dummy data and a demo Power BI dashboard created only for presentation and portfolio purposes.

🚀 Project Overview
During my internship at Jazz, I noticed that there was no structured feedback mechanism for merchants. To address this gap, I designed and implemented a feedback collection and analysis system.

The system allows JazzCash to:
Collect structured merchant feedback using Google Forms
Store responses in Google Sheets with FormRanger for dynamic dropdowns (Cities, Merchant Types, Supervisors)
Visualize feedback in Power BI through interactive dashboards

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Google Forms – Merchant feedback collection
FormRanger + Google Sheets – Dynamic dropdown lists & response storage
Power BI – KPIs, analytics, and interactive dashboards
