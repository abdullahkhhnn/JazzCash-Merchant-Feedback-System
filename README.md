# JazzCash-Merchant-Feedback-System

This repository contains a demo version of the Merchant Feedback System I developed during my internship as a B2B Intern at Jazz.

⚠️ Disclaimer: The original project was built using real JazzCash merchant data, which cannot be shared due to company policies. This repo contains dummy data and a demo Power BI dashboard created only for presentation and portfolio purposes.

As part of my internship as a B2B Intern at JazzCash, I had the chance to explore how merchant feedback can be structured, collected, and visualized. To practice these skills, I created a demo project with dummy data using:
Google Forms — for feedback collection
FormRanger + Google Sheets — for dynamic dropdowns and data storage
Power BI — for KPIs, dashboards, city-wise analysis, satisfaction trends, and problem tracking

This project was developed as a demo version for learning and presentation purposes only. The real systems at JazzCash provided me with valuable learning opportunities, and this demo helped me apply that knowledge in a practical way.

I’m sincerely thankful to JazzCash team and my supervisor Mansoor Ali Khan for their guidance, mentorship, and continuous support throughout this internship. This journey has been an incredible learning experience that has strengthened both my technical and professional skills.
